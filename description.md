# 1. The problem we solve

The problem our app tackles is sedentary lifestyle in young children. The problem is huge. We found many scientific papers to confirm it, but provided the selected ones due to the character limit.

It’s no big news that the sedentary lifestyle is a problem. Researchers and doctors across the globe [ring the bell] [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31221536/]

The problem is also acute in children: [WHO] [https://www.who.int/news/item/24-04-2019-to-grow-up-healthy-children-need-to-sit-less-and-play-more] and particularly in Europe: [OECD] [https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/1d229f1f-en/index.html?itemId=/content/component/1d229f1f-en]

From the paper above:
- Less than 18% of boys and 10% girls in Europe are physically active, which translates to roughly 86% of children leading sedentary lifestyle

Lack of physical activity affects physical and mental wellbeing, accumulating problems that can plague a child for the rest of their life unless changes are made.

The problem is grave and we took the challenge!

# 2. What real-world impact our app has

Targeting mainly young humans of 5-9 years old, MeMon is fun (and useful!)  to use for of all ages thanks to its mechanics.

While choosing features for the app, we again consulted [papers] [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5551109/]:

- “I sit because there is nobody to play (actively) with” → MeMon needs social mechanics
- “Sitting because there is nothing (active) to do” → MeMon has to be entertaining
- “Sitting because I can work/play better that way” → MeMon has to be convenient
- “Sitting because it is a habit” → MeMon has to develop healthy habits

By addressing the issues that keep children sedentary we root out the problem. How MeMon works then?

# 3. Our app

A user, most likely a child, gets a unique magical creature that resides in the phone and levels up and changes shape when a child stays physically active, which makes physical activity the source of care for the creature. 

A creature asks its child to do some exercise, for example to jump, and sees that they don’t undo- or overdo the exercise by tracking heartbeat through wearables and movements of child’s device.

A child can join its friends to do exercises and level up their creatures together. 

We further promote consistency via mechanics of streaks and achievements.

If a user is a child, the parents stay involved: they see stats on physical activity, control the friend list, and set up settings so that the creature knows when is appropriate time for physical activity and what kind of activity their kid prefers.

In the future, MeMon will integrate with GPS and weather services, have sleep tracking and emotion journalling, and include AR to make physical activity even more immersive and tailored to a user.

On top of that, the creature will weaken over time when a kid stays inactive (unless paused by parents), to demonstrate what of sedentary lifestyle leads to.
